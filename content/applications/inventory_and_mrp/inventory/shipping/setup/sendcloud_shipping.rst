Set up Sendcloud shipping services in Odoo
============================================

Sendcloud is a shipping service aggregator. Sendcloud facilitates the integration of European
shipping carriers with Odoo. Once integrated, the user can select the shipping carrier on inventory
operations in their Odoo database.

.. seealso::
   Here is `Sendcloud's documentation <https://support.sendcloud.com/hc/en-us/articles
   /360059470491-Odoo-integration>`_ on setting up the integration.

Setup in Sendcloud
===================

Create an account and activate carriers
---------------------------------------

To get started, go to `Sendcloud's platform <https://www.sendcloud.com>`_ to configure the account
and generate the connector credentials. Log in with the Sendcloud account.

If the user does not have a Sendcloud account, fill in the contact information and payment details.
Sendcloud will ask for a :abbr:`VAT (Value-Added Tax Identification)` number or :abbr:`EORI
(Economic Operators' Registration and Identification)` number. After completing the account setup,
activate (or deactivate) the shipping carriers that will be used in the Odoo database.

.. important::
   Odoo integration of Sendcloud does **not** work on free plans of Sendcloud.

Warehouse configuration
-----------------------

Once the Sendcloud account is created, set up the :guilabel:`Warehouse Address`. Start in the
Sendcloud account, go to :menuselection:`Settings --> Shipping --> Addresses`, and enter the
:guilabel:`Warehouse address`.

If the company would like Sendcloud to process returns as well, a :guilabel:`Return Address` is
required. Under the :guilabel:`Miscellaneous section`, there is a field called :guilabel:`Address
Name (optional)`. The Odoo warehouse name should be entered here, and the characters should be
exactly the same.

.. example::

   | **SendClould configuration:**
   | Miscellaneous
   | Address Name (optional): **Warehouse #1**
   | Brand: Default

   | **Odoo warehouse configuration:**
   | Warehouse: **Warehouse #1**
   | Short Name: WH
   | Company: My company (San Francisco)
   | Address: My Company (San Francisco)

   Notice how the name for both the Odoo configuration and the Sendcloud configuration are the exact
   same.

Creating credentials
--------------------

In the Sendcloud account, navigate to :menuselection:`Settings --> Integrations` in the menu on the
right. Next, search for :guilabel:`Odoo Native`. Then, click on :guilabel:`Connect`.

After clicking on :guilabel:`Connect`, the page redirects to the :guilabel:`Sendcloud API` settings
page, where the :guilabel:`Public and Secret Keys` are produced. The next step is to name the
:guilabel:`Integration`. The naming convention is as follows: `Odoo CompanyName`, with the user's
company name replacing `CompanyName`.

Then, check the box next to :guilabel:`Service Points` and select the shipping services for this
integration. After saving, the :guilabel:`Public and Secret Keys` are generated.

Setup in Odoo
=============

Install the Sendcloud shipping module
-------------------------------------

After the Sendcloud account is set up and configured, the user can configure their Odoo database.
To get started, go to Odoo's :guilabel:`Apps` module and search for the :guilabel:`Sendcloud
Shipping` module. Then, install this module, if it is not already installed.

Sendcloud shipping connector configuration
------------------------------------------

Ensure the :guilabel:`Sendcloud Shipping Module` is activated in :menuselection:`Inventory -->
Configuration --> Settings`. The :guilabel:`Sendcloud Connector` setting is found under the
:guilabel:`Shipping Connectors` section.

After activating the :guilabel:`Sendcloud Connector`, click on the :guilabel:`Sendcloud Shipping
Methods` link below the listed connector. Once on the :guilabel:`Shipping Methods` page, click
:guilabel:`Create`.

.. tip::
   :guilabel:`Shipping Methods` can also be accessed by going to :menuselection:`Inventory -->
   Configuration --> Delivery --> Shipping Methods`.

Fill out the following fields in the :guilabel:`New Shipping Method` form:

- :guilabel:`Shipping Method`: type `Sendcloud DPD`.
- :guilabel:`Provider`: select :guilabel:`Sendcloud` from the drop-down menu.
- :guilabel:`Delivery Product`: set the product that was configured for this shipping method or
  create a new product.
- In the :guilabel:`SendCloud Configuration` tab, enter the :guilabel:`Sendcloud Public Key`.
- In the :guilabel:`SendCloud Configuration` tab, enter the :guilabel:`Sendcloud Secret Key`.
- Manually :guilabel:`Save` the form by clicking the cloud icon next to the :guilabel:`Shipping
  Methods / New` breadcrumbs.

After configuring and saving the form, follow these steps to load the shipping products:

- In the :guilabel:`SendCloud Configuration` tab of the :guilabel:`New Shipping Method` form, click
  on the :guilabel:`Load your SendCloud shipping products` link.
- Select the shipping products the company would like to use for deliveries and returns.
- Click :guilabel:`Select`.

.. tip::
   Sendcloud does not provide test keys when a company tests the sending of a package in Odoo. This
   means if a package is created, the configured Sendcloud account will be charged, unless the
   associated package is canceled within 24 hours of creation.

   Odoo has built an extra layer of protection into test environments. If the shipping method is
   used to create a label, then the labels are immediately canceled after the creation. This occurs
   automatically. The test and production environments can toggled back and forth from the
   :guilabel:`Smart Buttons`.

Generate a label with Sendcloud
-------------------------------

When creating a quotation in Odoo, add shipping and a :guilabel:`Sendcloud shipping product`. Then,
:guilabel:`Validate` the delivery. Shipping label documents are automatically generated in the
chatter, which include the following:

#. :guilabel:`Shipping label(s)` (depending on the number of packages).
#. :guilabel:`Return label(s)` (if the Sendcloud connector is configured for returns).
#. :guilabel:`Customs document(s)` (should the destination country require them).

Additionally, the tracking number is now available.

.. important::
   When return labels are created, Sendcloud will automatically charge the configured Sendcloud
   account.

FAQ
===

Shipment is too heavy
---------------------

If the shipment is too heavy for the Sendcloud service that is configured, then the weight is split
to simulate multiple packages. Products will need to be put in different :guilabel:`Packages` to
:guilabel:`Validate` the transfer and generate labels.

:guilabel:`Rules` can also be set up in Sendcloud to use other shipping methods when the weight is
too heavy. However, it should be noted that these rules will not apply to the shipping price
calculation on the sales order.

When using a personal carrier contract
--------------------------------------

If using a personal carrier contract in Sendcloud, and the user finds the price is not accurately
reflected when creating a quotation in Odoo, the pricing needs to be updated in Sendcloud.

Measuring volumetric weight
---------------------------

Many carriers have several measures for weight. There is the actual weight of the products in the
parcel, and there is the *volumetric weight*. A carrier may have different formulas to compute the
volumetric weight.

Unable to calculate shipping rate
---------------------------------

First, verify that product being shipped has a weight that is supported by the selected shipping
method. If this is set, then verify that the destination country (from the customer address) is
supported by the carrier. The country of origin (warehouse address) should also be supported by
the carrier.
